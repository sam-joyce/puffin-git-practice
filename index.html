        <h1> Atif Uddin</h1>

        <p>I want to be a dev as I enjoy problem solving as well as the lifestyle of a dev and the endless opportunities and continous learning.
            I have friends who are also developers and engineers and they really enjoy their jobs as it lets them be creative and also have their own routine as the hybrid and remote work environments give them more freedom and choice.  </p>
