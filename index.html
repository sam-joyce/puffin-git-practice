<p>I want to be a developer as i see the opportunities in tech only continuing to grow. Also i love the way you can create, solve problems and generally dive into wormholes learning and attemting all the different things you can attempt. It scratches the creative itch for someone like me who has no arty bone in there body and you also get instant gratification seing what you have made.</p>
